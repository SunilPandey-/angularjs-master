<h3> How to Use the Scope? </h3> <br>
When you make a controller in AngularJS, you pass the $scope object as an argument.
When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) gets access to these properties.
In the view, you do not use the prefix $scope, you just refer to a propertyname, like {{carname}}.
<br>
<h3> Root Scope</h3>
All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.
The rootScope is available in the entire application.
If a variable has the same name in both the current scope and in the rootScope, the application use the one in the current scope.

<br>Angular Example:-  <br> <br>
<p> Color of Root scope is: </p> <h2> {{color}}</h2>

<div ng-controller = 'myCtrl'>

    <p> Color of Controller myCtrl is : </p> <h2> {{color}}</h2>

</div>

<p> Color of root scope is still : </p> <h2>{{color}}</h2>

<h3> Run Function</h3>
<br>
Run blocks are the closest thing in Angular to the main method.
A run block is the code which needs to run to kickstart the application.
It is executed after all of the service have been configured and the injector has been created.
Run blocks typically contain code which is hard to unit-test, and for this reason should be declared in isolated modules,
so that they can be ignored in the unit-tests.
